Team,RQ1_Confidence,RQ1_Count,TechniqueTeam1,4,2,"We use a variety of different regressions.  First, we use ordinary least squares with robust standard errors and control for various things such as height, weight, age.  We also add in fixed effects for league country, position, club, and referee.  In addition, we employ a logistic regression and nonlinear regression to compare with our OLS regressions.
