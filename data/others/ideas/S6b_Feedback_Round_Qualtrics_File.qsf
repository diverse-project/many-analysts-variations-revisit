transformations (if any) were applied to the variables. Please be specific. <\/b>\n<br>We chose NOT to transform the redCards measure into a proportion, because this would equate a player who received 0 cards in one game with a referee and a player who received 0 cards in 20 games.  Instead, we controlled for games as a covariate in all analyses.  Height and Weight were used to calculate BMI, which we thought provided a better measure of physical stature than either measure alone.  Birthday was used to calculate player age (in days) as of 1\/1\/2013 to evaluate whether this was confounded with skin tone.  An aggregate goals\/game variable was calculated at the player level to examine how \"star status\" might influence the results.  Another set of aggregate variables were calculated at the club level to examine whether mean skin tone of one's club, mean goals\/game, and mean losing percentage had any additional influence.  Supplementary analyses were performed with a transformed skin tone variable in which players with mean ratings < 3 were categorized as Non-African-appearing and players with mean ratings >3 were categorized as African-appearing.  This was based on a visual inspection of the players sorted into the different skin tone categories and was intended to provide a more focused test of the IAT and explicit prejudice hypotheses which were built specifically on attitudes toward blacks.\n<br>\n<br><b>Were any cases excluded, and why?<\/b>\n<br>In the supplementary analyses, players with mean skin tone ratings of 3 were excluded, because that group included both players who were African-appearing and Non-African-appearing, which would make focused tests of prejudice toward blacks vs. whites more difficult.  All other exclusions were only the result of missing data on some of the required measures.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is the name of the statistical technique that you employed?<\/b>\n<br>Multilevel regression analyses.\n<br>\n<br><b>Please describe the statistical technique you chose in more detail. Be specific, especially if your choice is not one you consider to be well-known. <\/b>\n<br>Because of the extensive nesting and multiple sources of dependency within the data, we used techniques that could account for this dependency and examine the interactions between variables at different levels of nesting.  Before conducting the primary analyses, we tested which types of nesting were explaining significant variance in the outcome of interest before adopting that nesting structure for all subsequent analyses.  Results showed that referee country and referee were factors that contributed significant random variance to the model.  Therefore, a three-level structure was adopted in which referee was nested within referee country and intercepts were allowed to vary randomly across these levels.  Further analyses showed that the skin tone slope effect did not contribute significant random variance, and thus these effects were always treated as fixed in the model.\n<br>\n<br><b>What are some references for the statistical technique that you chose?<\/b>\n<br>Raudenbush, S.

We discussed transforming the data into proportions and then transforming the results with an arcsin function, but we decided against this because it equated people who received 0 red cards in 1 game with a referee and people who received 0 red cards in 20.  We also discussed recategorizing the red cards variable into a binomial and performing a logistic regression, but we did not choose this approach because of the same problem and it potentially eliminated meaningful variance among those few cases in which players did receive multiple red cards across a varying number of games.  Finally, we decided against a poisson regression because the maximum count for red cards was two.

Please be specific. <\/b>\n<br>This might not be the type of transformations that you are asking about, but for all analyses, a new player skin rating variable was derived which was simply the arithmetic average of the 'rater 1' and 'rater 2' variables in the original dataset (this was justified because of the high interrater reliability of .924, p < .001).  This new average skin tone variable was the one used in the analyses below, and will be referred to as average skin tone. \/ The birthdate variable was used to create a new variable representing player age.  This was done by choosing an arbitrary date within the soccer season under consideration (01\/01\/2013) and then calculating player age based on their birthdate and this arbitrary date. This variable will be referred to as player age below. \/ The position variable was used to create 12 new variables to represent each of the 12 positions listed in the position variable.  It should be noted that we would not include all 12 position variables (contrasts) in a single regression model because only 11 would be needed (the 12th would be redundant and not provide additional information).  However, all 12 were created because the zero-order relations among these 12 and red cards and skin tone were conducted as part of the process for determining which should be considered as potential covariates (see answer to covariate question below for more details).  For each of these new variables, players were assigned a 0 if the position variable under consideration was not their position or a 1 if it was their position (if they were missing data on the original position variable, then their data was coded as missing on all of the new 12 position variables).  When referred to below in the covariates section, these new variables will be called: position-Attacking Midfielder, position-Center Back, position-Center Forward, position-Center Midfielder, position-Defensive Midfielder, position-Goalkeeper, position-Left Fullback, position-Left Midfielder, position-Left Winger, position-Right Fullback, position-Right Midfielder, and position-Right Winger. \/ The leagueCountry variable was used to create 4 new variables to represent each of the 4 countries listed in this variable (similar to above, no more than 3 of these would be included as covariates because the 4th would not provide information beyond three).  As with above, players were assigned a 0 if the leagueCountry variable under consideration was not their club's country or a 1 if it was. When referred to below in the covariates section, these new variables will be called: country-England, country-France, country-Germany, and country-Spain. \/ When testing research question 1, the dataset was restructured such that each case was a single player as opposed to the original dataset where each case was a player-referee dyad. Thus, the number of cases was reduced from 146,028 player-referee dyads to 2,053 players.  As part of this data restructuring, the original variables of games, victories, ties, defeats, goals, yellowCards, yellowReds, and redCards were 'transformed' in the sense that their values were summed across referee-player dyads for each player.  Below, these variables will be referred to as total games, total victories, total ties, total defeats, total goals, total yellowCards, total yellowReds, and total redCards \/ When testing research question 2a and 2b, the meanIAT, meanExp, and average skin tone variables were all transformed by mean centering them.  This was done by calculating a mean for each variable and then subtracting that mean from each score.  An interaction term was then created by multiplying the centered meanIAT variable and the centered average skin tone variable.  Another interaction term was created by multiplying the centered meanExp variable and the centered average skin tone variable. \/ When testing research questions 2a and 2b, the redCards variable was transformed for each player-referee dyad to create a dichotomous red card variable.  Thus, if no red card was given, a value of zero was assigned as in the original redCards variable, and if one or more red cards were given, a value of one was assigned to indicate that the specific referee had given at least 1 red card to the specific player. This was done as only 0.017120% (25 of 146,028) of the player-referee dyads with red card data awarded more than one red card.\n<br>\n<br><b>Were any cases excluded, and why?<\/b>\n<br>Any cases with missing data on the variables under consideration in a given analysis were excluded from that analysis.  Thus, the final analysis for question 1 consisted of 1,433 of 2,053 (69.8%) players.  Those excluded from analysis were missing position data (n = 152), skin tone ratings (n = 253), or both position data and skin tone ratings (n = 215). \/ The final analysis for questions 2a and 2b consisted of 116,014 of 146,028 (79.5%) player-referee dyads.

In the data restructured to have players as the unit of analysis (rather than player-referee dyads), the zero-order correlations were examined between all potential covariates and both total red cards and average skin tone.  All variables that demonstrated a significant zero-order correlation with either total red cards, average skin tone, or both were included in the preliminary, full regression analysis for research question 1.  For the preliminary, full regression analysis, there were several variables whose coefficients were not significant.  The variable with the largest p value, position-Center Midfielder, was removed and it was verified that removing this variable did not result in a significant decrement in model fit.  The resulting model was also examined to see whether or not the parameter estimates for average skin tone were impacted by removal of the position-Center Midfielder variable. This was done because although the position-Center Midfielder variable did not provide significant, unique prediction of red cards, it was still possible that its inclusion influenced the relation between skin tone and red cards. There was little change in the parameter estimates for the relation between skin tone and red cards upon removal of the position-Center Midfielder variable. Thus, the position-Center Midfielder variable was not included in the final model as a covariate because it seemed more parsimonious to exclude this variable because it did not contribute significantly to the model and its removal did not have a meaningful impact on the relation of interest (the relation between skin tone and red cards).  This process was carried out until all of the remaining variables had coefficients that were statistically significant and whose removal resulted in a significant decrement in model fit.

(Violation of normality assumption.)  A standard approach with count data is to employ some version of a Poisson distribution.  Since these data are relatively rare events, there is a much higher number of zeros than a standard Poisson distribution can account for.   There are two methods to deal with a \"high\" zero distribution in count data--a hurdle distribution and a zero-inflated distribution.  Both of these are mixture distributions, in which one distribution is chosen for the zeroes and another for the non-zero counts.  A hurdle distribution assumes there is some sort of \"threshold\" that must be passed, after which counts are distributed in a particular manner.  A zero-inflated distribution (used in this analysis) makes no modeling assumptions about the causes for zeroes.  Of important note in both of these appraches is that coefficients are produced for both parts of the distrbution, so we can answer both \"what creates non-zero counts of red cards\" and \"what creates more red cards in one dyad than another\".

The estimated relationship between the two variables is obtained by minimizing the sum of squared vertical distances between the observed values in the sample, and the predicted values of the linear approximation. Since the number of games varies across player-referee dyads, we weight the observations by the number of games per player-referee dyad. This means that we use WLS.  \/  \/ To answer research question 1 we regress the total number of red and yellow-red cards per game on a continuous variable indicating the player's skin tone (the average value of rater 1 and rater 2) on a 1-5 scale.

If we do not control for these variables, we therefore risk getting a biased estimate of the relationship between skin tone and the likelihood of being awarded a red or a yellow-red card.  Assume for instance that players of a certain skin tone on average are taller than other players, and that taller players are on average awarded more red and yellow-red cards. Then, if we do not control for height, it may appear as if players of that particular skin tone are discriminated against although it is rather their height, and not their skin tone, that increases their likelihood of receiving a red or yellow-red card.  \/  \/ We also include referee fixed effects. This implies that we measure the effect of skin tone on the likelihood of receiving a red or yellow-red card within referees. That is, for a given referee, we analyze whether a player's likelihood of receiving a red or yellow-red card varies with his skin tone.  \/  \/ It is important to point out that the data set is insufficient to identify any causal effect of skin color on the probability of getting a red or yellow-red card. We can only estimate if the likelihood of getting a red or yellow-red card varies with skin color after controlling for as many variables as possible; but this variation may be correlated with unobserved factors affecting the likelihood of getting such a card. The most important unobserved variable here is 'player style'; i.e. to what extent the player style is correlated with skin color (skin color could for instance be correlated with how physical a player plays, affecting the likelihood of getting yellow and red cards).

Interaction between explicit bias score and player skin tone (EbiasSkin). \/  \/ We decided to leave out league country as a predictor, because any differences due to this predictor will be accounted for by referee strictness and player aggression. Other possible predictors were deemed superfluous or uninformative and were not added to the regression equation. For instance, player position is not all that informative after player aggression has already been included in the model. Predictors (3) and (4) are included to keep the interaction terms interpretable.  \/  \/ The first research question, \"Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?\", can be quantified by the importance of predictor 5, player skin tone. \/  \/ The second research question, \"Are soccer referees from countries high in skin-tone prejudice more likely to award red cards to dark skin toned players?\", can be quantified by the importance of predictors 6 and 7 (interaction between implicit and explicit bias and player skin tone). \/  \/ To quantify the importance of predictors 5, 6, and 7, we compare the full regression model (that includes all of the predictors) to three simplified regression models: (1) model A has all predictors except 5; (2) model B has all predictors except 6; (3) model C has all predictors except 7. Whenever the full model outperforms its simplified versions, this constitutes evidence for the inclusion of the associated predictor. \/  \/ To fit the models and quantify this evidence we use Bayesian inference. We first assign each regression coefficient an independent standard Normal distribution. This is not important for the nuisance predictors 1-4, but it is important for the predictors of interest. We still need to conduct a sensitivity analysis and consider ways to motivate the choice for a particular width.  \/  \/ Next we fit the full regression model to the data (using the JAGS code provided later in this form). Parameter estimation results can be gauged by plotting the posterior distributions for the relevant regression coefficients. Each posterior distribution can be summarized by its mean and a 95% credible interval. For hypothesis testing, we compute three Bayes factors based on the comparison between the full model against each of three simplified models that omit one of the three key predictors. \/  \/ Because the simple models are nested in the full model, we can compute the Bayes factor using the Savage-Dickey density ratio; that is, we compute the ratio between the prior and the posterior ordinate at the value under test (i.e., beta = 0).

Therefore, a player-referee dyad observation with 8 games was transformed into 8 different player-referee'game observations.  This expanded the number of rows in the data set to equal the number of games played by players instead of the number of dyads that existed. In addition, certain control variables were transformed in minor ways.  Namely we included squared values of age, height, and weight as addition controls and created an average rater value (a simple average of the two skin-tone ratings). We also create a standardized mean iat score and exp score with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for each of the countries with iat and exp scores.\n<br>\n<br><b>Were any cases excluded, and why?<\/b>\n<br>We did not exclude any cases.

Additionally, Xi is a vector of player characteristics including height, height-squared, weight, weight-squared, age, and age-squared.

Equation (2) is estimated separately for light and dark skin-tone players.  The estimate to answer question 2a is the difference between these two estimates.

Equation (3) is estimated separately for light and dark skin-tone players.  The estimate to answer question 2b is the difference between these two estimates.  The only covariates included are player fixed effects.  \/\n<br>\n<br><b>What theoretical and\/or statistical rationale was used for your choice of covariates included in the models?<\/b>\n<br>We are concerned with whether or not having darker skin causes you to receive more cautionary cards and thus we try to control for anything that reasonably could affect cautionary cards.  For example, perhaps (and it appears to be the case) defenders receive many more cautionary cards than the average forward.  Since this is the case we must control for it either in the form of a player-position fixed effect or a more over-arching player fixed effect. Ideally we would be able to control for all characteristics correlated with skin-tone and correlated with being given a card.  Where this is not possible, we include the statistics that reasonably seem may have a relationship with cards and skin-tone.  The size, position, and league of the player all seem like possible candidates.  As can be seen in our tables, the addition of covariates allow for robustness checks.  Due to the lack of an identification strategy for question 1, there is no way of knowing if the estimates that come from our estimates for question 1 are causal.  There are likely other variables that should be controlled for but are not.  I would only believe our estimates for questions 1 with skepticism. For questions 2a and 2b a good identification strategy is used.

Please be specific. <\/b>\n<br>We transformed the main dependent measure, the number of red cards, to a frequency score of 'red cards per game per player'. This was done by standardizing the number of games to one, by calculating the number of red cards per game. By construction the new variable ranges from 0 to 1, and can be interpreted as the probability of receiving a red card. Note that we made no distinction in the 'type' of red card ( i.e. a direct red or twice yellow where treated equally). \/ We also standardized (z-values) all continuous predictors before analysis. For skin color, we took the average of the two skin color ratings, given high agreement. This variable ranges from 1 to 5.  \/\n<br>\n<br><b>Were any cases excluded, and why?<\/b>\n<br>We did not exclude any cases from the data analysis.

Be specific, especially if your choice is not one you consider to be well-known. <\/b>\n<br>At first sight, methods using count data may seem appropriate to use (i.e. a negative binomial or Poisson regression). However, these methods assume that the number of trials (in this case 'games played') is the same for every observation. Including the number of games as a regressor mitigates this problem, but only to some extent.  To solve this issue, we transformed the dependent variable and bounded it between 0 and 1. OLS is then no longer appropriate. We choose to apply a Tobit analysis instead because the different numbers of games per player put an upper bound on how many red cards each player can receive. This analytical technique adequately handles this kind of censored data.  \/ As the number of times that a player encounters the same referee can affect the average frequency of receiving a red card, we ran standard model specifications and model specifications with frequency weights to each player-referee dyad. Frequency weighing entailed that, for example, a player-referee dyad that has 10 encounters is weighted 10 times more than a player-referee dyad that only had one encounter. Because this weighted method blows up the number of observations, we adjusted the standard errors for clusters of repeated observations at different levels. This adjustment generally does not affect the point estimate, merely the significance of the effect. We ended up running 4 different model specifications depending on the clusters (either club or country) and frequency weights (yes vs. no). This did not make much difference for the results. The results we report here are the ones in which we used frequency weights and clustered for country.  \/  \/ Because the level of analysis for this question is player, we aggregated the data to the player level. Across all four model specifications, we found that the effect of Skin color was statistically significant at a 10% significant level. \/ We found that a player with a very dark skin color has 0.2% higher likelihood of receiving a red card compared to a player with a very light skin. This seems very small, but considering that the average number of red cards is about 0.8%, this effect may be considered as quite large. It implies that for every 4 red cards a player with skincolor 1 receives, a player with skin color 5 will receive an additional red card (to a total of 5.)   \/  \/ To test Hypothesis 2, we tried to reproduce the results for the aggregated data with the disaggregated data, either clustered on player or referee observations. Now, the main effect of skin color on frequency of cards is even larger (b = 0.0278, t = 2.59, p < .01). We subsequently included the two prejudice variables in specifications 5 and 6 and the first interaction term (IAT x skin color) in specification 7. This interaction-term did not yield a significant effect. This result suggests that the relationship between skin color and the average frequency of red cards does not depend on this implicit prejudice measure.  The second interaction term (Explicit x Skin color), which was entered in specification 8, was also insignificant. This result suggests that the relationship between skin color and the average frequency of red cards does not depend on this explicit prejudice measure.   \/  \/  \/\n<br>\n<br><b>What are some references for the statistical technique that you chose?<\/b>\n<br>William H.

In this data study we might expect there to be some referees who have a greater propensity to award cards in any game and similarly some who award fewer. Which specific referees these are is not our primary question of interest and may be different in a new set of games.

Multiple models were considered before selecting that with the lowest AIC as our final model. \/  \/ The player and referee were included as random effects. The player random effect aims to account for variation amongst players in propensity to be booked (independent of skin tone) and the referee random effect aims to account for variation in strictness amongst referees (again independent of player skin tone) \/  \/ As fixed effects we included the covariates (as factors) of position played and league. This aimed to take account of the potentially unbalanced nature of the dataset i.e. that the four different leagues may have different numbers of cards awarded and that the skin tone of players in different leagues could be unbalanced. Similarly we felt that different positions are more\/less likely to be red carded and certain positions may be more associated with particular skin tone. \/  \/ One could potentially consider league as a random (instead of fixed) effect but we felt there may be specific interest in the four major European leagues and not more general. We did also investigate if there was an interaction between league and skin tone (i.e. some leagues were more likely to give red cards to certain skin tones) but found no evidence for this. \/  \/ Finally as specific interest was in whether the bias score of the referee's home country was significant we also included two interactions: the first between the meanIAT (Implicit Bias) score and skin tone in our model; and the second between the mean (Explicit Bias) score and skin tone. Inclusion of both bias scores simultaneously means that one needs to be careful when interpreting results - comparisons are made conditional on all other variables being equal.  \/  \/ It is not therefore possible to consider the Implicit and Explicit bias effects separately. One can instead compare two countries with the same Implicit bias scores but different Explicit bias scores; or vice versa. We are therefore concerned that results could be misinterpreted due to high correlation between implicit and explicit bias. Generalised statements about a general effect of explicit bias to compare two countries (as if one can ignore also the implicit bias) must be treated with caution. We are hence presuming that in any specific comparison\/prediction between countries all the fixed variables are known or at least considered to be equal.

If that is indeed the question we want to answer, then it seems obvious that we want to control for as many other characteristics as we can that might potentially bias the coefficient on skin tone, given that skin tone is obviously not randomly assigned. Coming up with a story of omitted variable bias for all the included controls is simple: for example, if darker skin toned players are more (or less) prevalent in Spain's league, and Spain's league gives out more (or fewer) redcards, then the coefficient on skin tone in a regression without league of play would be biased.\n<br>\n<br><b>What unit is your effect size in?<\/b>\n<br>Marginal Probability\n","DataExportTag":"Approach2","QuestionID":"QID10","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","QuestionDescription":"Analytical Approach Team2What transformations (if any) were applied to the variables.\nPlease be specific.\nSeveral versions of the skin-tone rating were used (min, max, mean,\nfirst rating, second ra..."}},{"SurveyID":"SV_24vHvL0afJaCXYN","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID99","SecondaryAttribute":"Analytical Approach Team30What transformations (if any) were applied to the\nvariables.

Of course, having received a red card in 47 games is far different from having received a red card based on a single played game. The obvious thing to do here is to disaggregate the dyads into games. However, this was not straightforward, since the correlation with other variables also aggregated (e.g., number of yellow-cards, number of goals) is unknown on the level of games. Instead, we divided each game-specific outcome (red cards, yellow cards, victories, defeats, goals, ties) by the number of games played, thus rendering the variables the probability of the event occurring during a game. The exception was the goals per game variable where it is possible to score more than one goal per game.

Be specific, especially if your choice is not one you consider to be well-known. <\/strong>\n<br>Because there was very little variation beyond 0 or 1 red cards, we decided on treating the dependent variable as a dummy and choose to analyze the results by means of logistic regression, treating any non-zero probability as having received (at least) one red card. Another reason for choosing logistic regression is that the dependent variable does not have very much meaning in an absolute sense and thus absolute changes in probabilities (e.g., from an OLS, probit or tobit) would be hard to interpret. Odds ratios, in contrast, are commonly used as effect sizes for relative effects. In this case, the relative change in the odds of receiving a red card as a function of your skin color.Because the 123,056 observations was based on observations from 1572 players and 3147 referees, and one could expect correlation both within players and within referees in the number of red cards, it was necessary to take into account this hierarchical structure of the data. One approach to do so is to adjust the standard errors through clustering. The main advantage of this over other approaches (e.g., multi-level modeling) is that conventional regression analysis, such as logit in this case, can be used with a simple adjustment. However, the program we used (STATA 12) does not include a command for multi-way clustering. We thus used an add-on (logit2) for this.&nbsp; Thus for Q1, we used a logistic regression with two-way clustering on referee and player, with the dependent variable being whether an encounter between a player and a referee resulted in a red-card or not. In the first model, we included only skin tone (standardized) as predictor. In the second model we also included controls: weight and height (standardized) and position (effect coded in order to base the constant on the grand mean and simply comparison to unadjusted model). For Q2, both referees and players are nested within the country of which the IAT and explicit measure is taken from, and we thus clustered only on this highest level (using the logit command in STATA 12). As in the previous analysis, we started without controls and thus only included the IAT and the explicit variable (standardized) as well as their interaction with skin tone rating. These interaction effects served as our answer to Q2. If prejudice matters, then there should be a positive interaction effect in that the skin tone effect is stronger for those with higher prejudice on the&nbsp; IAT and\/or the explicit measures.

The original response variable redCards is uninterpretable because the number of games a player has seen a given referee varies. Therefore we disaggregated the data (one game per row, redCards appear as 1s in the first n=redCards rows per player). This was possible because it does not matter in which of, for example, 3 games a player who received 1 red card in 3 games received the red card. It is sufficient that this player has three observations (three rows) associated with him, one of them indicating a red card.
